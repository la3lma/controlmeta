   1. Put original image into ctrl-meta.
   2. Put a task for detecting images into ctrl-meta
   3. Make an agent that can pick up face detection
      tasks and and put results back into ctrl-meta.
   4. Make a script that can extract the content that's
      stored and present it in a consistent manner
      (as a webservice, webpage or something like that).

  sweeter to look at.
