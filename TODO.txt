o Extend functionality to a level where it's actually useful to 
  the task at hand.

o Run some tests using postgresql both on workstation and in beanstalk

o Create a postgresql instance to be used in production.

o Write management scripts for elastic beanstalk that will let us
  create a new database instance when required.

o Necessary refactoring:
  o Esthetics
      - Read throught the coding standards for Python and become
        more compliant
      - Better esthetics, documentation and readability
      - Get someone with practice in python programming to critique the code
      - Get some gerrit-like service to use for that?

  o Make the metadata contain some automatically generated fields,
     and then a separate namespace for the user-provided data.  This
     will be -exactly- the same schema we need to use for tasks.
     That is a symmetry we may be able to use in some way. 
   o The content/metadata  API is a bit screwed.  It needs to be
       refactored into prettiness asap.
   o Then the whole test infrastructure needs to be brought
      in line with this refactoring, then we can proceed.

o Possibly useful features
  o Oauth? Using Google IDs or perhaps Yahoo IDs.
  o Ensure that we can upload big data objects (images, movies)

o Actually doing something useful
  o Make a small worker that does something to an image.
  o Write some code that actually uses the ting to do something useful,
    such as identifying images with faces.
